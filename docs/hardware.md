# Hardware

Status: phase 1. **No board is selected, no synthesis has been run, and no
hardware has been programmed.** Every figure below is `TBD` and stays that way
until a tool report or a measurement exists.

## Target device

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Vendor | not selected |
| Device | not selected |
| Toolchain | not selected |
| Tool version | TBD |

`configs/hardware.yaml` holds `null` for all four. The core RTL is written to be
board-independent; anything board-specific belongs under `fpga/`.

## Pixel stream interface

| Signal | Direction | Width | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
These are the ports `rtl/fpga_denoiser_top.sv` actually has; the table used to
list a planned interface (`in_valid`, `frame_start`, `line_start`) that the
module never grew.

| `clk` | in | 1 | pixel clock |
| `rst_n` | in | 1 | synchronous reset, active LOW |
| `s_valid` | in | 1 | `s_pixel` is valid this cycle |
| `s_pixel` | in | 8 | unsigned 0-255, raster order |
| `s_flush` | in | 1 | hold for IMG_WIDTH+2 cycles after a frame to drain |
| `s_ready` | out | 1 | sink can accept (always high; no back-pressure) |
| `m_valid` | out | 1 | `m_pixel` is valid this cycle |
| `m_pixel` | out | 8 | unsigned 0-255 |
| `m_ready` | in | 1 | accepted only to detect a dropped pixel, see `m_overflow` |
| `m_overflow` | out | 1 | sticky: a pixel was produced while `m_ready` was low |
| `filter_sel` | in | 2 | `00` bypass, `01` median, `10` Gaussian, `11` Wiener |
| `noise_var` | in | 16 | Wiener noise power in squared grey levels, written per frame |

`filter_sel` and `noise_var` are combinational control: they apply to the window
in the generator that cycle, which trails the input pixel by IMG_WIDTH+1. Change
them between frames.

`backpressure` is `false` in the configuration: the first implementation is a
valid-only stream. `in_ready` / `out_ready` are added later, and the config flag
is what says which of the two is built.

## Fixed-point formats

| Quantity | Format |
|---|---|
| Pixel | unsigned 8-bit, 0-255 |
| Gaussian accumulator | unsigned 13-bit (max 255 x 16 = 4080) |
| Wiener window sum | unsigned 12-bit (max 9 x 255 = 2295) |
| Wiener sum of squares | unsigned 20-bit (max 9 x 255^2 = 585225) |
| Wiener 81*variance | unsigned 24-bit, exact (9*SUM(x^2) - (SUM x)^2) |
| Wiener gain | Q8 unsigned, clamped to [0, 255] |
| Wiener accumulator | signed 24-bit |
| `noise_var` | unsigned 16-bit (255^2 = 65025 is the largest meaningful value) |
